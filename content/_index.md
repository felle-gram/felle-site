**Hey there! i’m Felle 👋**

welcome to my little corner of the internet—part portfolio, part brain dump, all here. you’ll find my projects, ramblings, and whatever else i’m excited about.

---

### **what’s inside?**
- **stuff i’ve made:** websites, experiments, and things that go *beep boop*
- **thoughts & notes:** half-baked ideas, tutorials, and the occasional deep dive
- **nerdy loves:** code, design, and all things web

---

### **why this site?**
because the internet should be fun, weird, and full of personality. also, i wanted a place to dump my projects without bothering algorithms.
